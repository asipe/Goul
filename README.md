***This is all a work in progress***

##How to run DocumentUploader.Console
  
  Run: scripts\init_minion.ps1
  
  In the command line: 
  
  - minion bootstrap
  - minion clean, build
  
  - To run the unit tests: minion run.unit.tests.dbg
  
  The executable to run DocumentUploader.Console is located in bin\debug\DocumentUploader.Console.exe
  
  When running, pass it an argument => "help" (That's literally all it does right now)
